me	1

as	1
you	1
may	1

i	1
had	1
no	1

in	1
taking	1
my	1
right	1

on	1

there	1
was	1
a	1
trooper	1
with	1
a	1
red	1

on	1
a	1
flea-bitten	1
grey	1

i	1
had	1
observed	1
that	1
my	1
post	1
was	1
always	1
immediately	1
in	1

of	1
him	1

this	1
saved	1

the	1

day	1

when	1

came	1

galloped	1
up	1

down	1

the	1
deuce	1
a	1

of	1

at	1

i	1
formed	1
up	1
in	1

been	1
put	1
there	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
ground	1

the	1
major	1
so	1
far	1
forgot	1
himself	1

knew	1
nothing	1

perhaps	1

of	1
doing	1
so	1
tough	1
a	1

an	1
injury	1

would	1
certainly	1
prevent	1
him	1
from	1

even	1
with	1
a	1

he	1
might	1
pull	1
the	1

therefore	1
,	1
to	1
prevent	1
his	1
making	1

him	1
off	1

this	1
neglect	1

led	1
to	1
an	1

i	1
have	1
learned	1
in	1

that	1

an	1

a	1

we	1
may	1

that	1
it	1
is	1

his	1
guilt	1

as	1
the	1

mitigation	1
of	1

that	1

not	1
yet	1
one	1

twenty	1

of	1
age	1

me	1

spare	1
him	1

should	1

that	1

never	1
again	1

lay	1
his	1

upon	1
a	1

take	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
his	1

to	1
me	1

out	1
at	1

with	1

upon	1

i	1
had	1
at	1

to	1
stop	1

was	1
seen	1
by	1
the	1
rustics	1

the	1

i	1
was	1
proud	1

to	1
see	1
that	1
you	1
had	1
the	1

of	1

that	1

edward	1

if	1
you	1

seen	1
our	1
boy	1

like	1
a	1

beating	1
against	1
the	1

you	1
would	1
have	1

to	1
give	1
him	1
even	1
so	1
short	1
a	1
flight	1
as	1
this	1

i	1
do	1
not	1
blame	1
you	1
,	1
mary	1

it	1
is	1
possible	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
have	1
done	1
so	1
.	1
he	1
went	1
to	1
london	1
,	1
and	1
he	1
tried	1
to	1
open	1
a	1
career	1
for	1
himself	1
by	1
his	1
own	1
strength	1
and	1
courage	1
.	1
how	1
many	1
of	1
our	1

have	1
done	1
the	1

,	1
save	1
only	1
that	1
a	1
sword-hilt	1
lay	1
in	1
their	1
closed	1
hands	1
;	1
but	1
of	1
them	1
all	1
i	1
do	1
not	1
know	1
that	1
any	1
have	1
carried	1
themselves	1
more	1
gallantly	1

that	1
i	1
dare	1

and	1
then	1
,	1
when	1
harrison	1
at	1
last	1
returned	1
,	1
i	1
learned	1
that	1
my	1
son	1
was	1
actually	1
matched	1
to	1
fight	1
in	1
a	1
public	1
prize-battle	1
.	1
that	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
,	1
charles	1
!	1
it	1
was	1
one	1
thing	1
to	1
fight	1
as	1
you	1
and	1
i	1
have	1
fought	1
in	1
our	1
youth	1
,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
another	1
to	1
compete	1
for	1
a	1
purse	1
of	1
gold	1

my	1
dear	1

how	1
could	1
you	1
do	1
otherwise	1
?	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
not	1
do	1
!	1
i	1
determined	1
that	1
the	1
time	1
had	1
come	1
when	1
i	1
should	1
reveal	1
myself	1
to	1
my	1
son	1
,	1
the	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
there	1
were	1
many	1

my	1

seriously	1
weakened	1

health	1

shall	1
i	1
not	1
rather	1
say	1
providence	1

had	1
at	1
last	1
made	1
clear	1
all	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
dark	1
,	1
and	1
given	1
me	1
the	1
means	1
of	1
establishing	1
my	1
innocence	1
.	1
my	1
wife	1
went	1
yesterday	1
to	1
bring	1
my	1
boy	1
at	1
last	1
to	1
the	1
side	1
of	1
his	1
unfortunate	1

,	1
after	1

i	0
counted	0
the	0

brought	0
me	0
nearer	0

my	0

might	0
ring	0
for	0

hour	0
they	0
liked	0
,	0
they	0
always	0
found	0
me	0

so	0
that	0
this	0
young	0
captain	0
hiccoughed	0
out	0
that	0
i	0
was	0
the	0
model	0
of	0
all	0

my	0
master	0
advised	0
me	0
to	0
go	0

he	0
had	0
noticed	0
my	0
flushed	0
cheek	0

my	0

eyes	0
,	0
and	0
he	0
set	0
me	0
down	0
as	0
being	0
in	0
a	0
fever	0
.	0
so	0
i	0
was	0
,	0
but	0
it	0
was	0
a	0
fever	0
which	0
only	0
one	0
medicine	0
could	0
assuage	0
.	0

then	0
at	0
last	0
,	0
very	0
early	0
in	0
the	0
morning	0
,	0
i	0
heard	0
them	0
push	0
back	0
their	0

i	0
knew	0
that	0
their	0
game	0
had	0
at	0

come	0
to	0
an	0
end	0
.	0
when	0
i	0
entered	0
the	0
room	0
to	0
receive	0
my	0
orders	0
,	0
i	0
found	0
that	0

already	0
stumbled	0
off	0
to	0
bed	0

the	0

also	0
retired	0
,	0
and	0
my	0

alone	0
at	0
the	0
table	0

with	0
his	0
empty	0
bottle	0

the	0
scattered	0

me	0
angrily	0
to	0
my	0
room	0

and	0
this	0
time	0
i	0
obeyed	0
him	0

my	0
first	0
care	0
was	0
to	0

myself	0
with	0
a	0
weapon	0

i	0
knew	0
that	0
if	0
i	0
were	0
face	0
to	0
face	0
with	0
him	0
i	0
could	0
tear	0
his	0
throat	0
out	0
,	0
but	0
i	0
must	0
so	0
arrange	0
that	0
the	0
fashion	0
of	0
his	0
death	0
should	0
be	0
a	0
noiseless	0
one	0
.	0
there	0
was	0
a	0
hunting	0
trophy	0
in	0
the	0
hall	0
,	0
and	0
from	0
it	0
i	0
took	0
a	0
straight	0
heavy	0
knife	0
which	0
i	0
sharpened	0
upon	0
my	0
boot	0
.	0
then	0
i	0
stole	0
to	0
my	0
room	0
,	0
and	0
sat	0
waiting	0
upon	0
the	0
side	0
of	0
my	0
bed	0

i	0
had	0
made	0
up	0
my	0

what	0
i	0
should	0
do	0
.	0
there	0
would	0
be	0
little	0
satisfaction	0
in	0
killing	0
him	0
if	0
he	0
was	0
not	0
to	0
know	0
whose	0
hand	0
had	0
struck	0
the	0
blow	0
,	0
or	0
which	0
of	0
his	0

it	0
came	0
to	0

could	0
i	0
but	0
bind	0
him	0
and	0
gag	0
him	0
in	0
his	0
drunken	0
sleep	0
,	0
then	0
a	0
prick	0
or	0
two	0
of	0
my	0
dagger	0
would	0
arouse	0
him	0
to	0
listen	0
to	0
what	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
say	0
to	0
him	0
.	0
i	0
pictured	0
the	0
look	0
in	0
his	0
eyes	0
as	0
the	0
haze	0
of	0
sleep	0
cleared	0
slowly	0
away	0
from	0
them	0
,	0
the	0
look	0
of	0
anger	0
turning	0
suddenly	0
to	0
stark	0
horror	0
as	0
he	0
understood	0
who	0
i	0
was	0
and	0
what	0
i	0
had	0
come	0
for	0
.	0
it	0
would	0
be	0
the	0
supreme	0
moment	0
of	0
my	0
life	0

i	0
waited	0
as	0
it	0
seemed	0
to	0
me	0
for	0
at	0

an	0
hour	0
;	0
but	0
i	0
had	0
no	0
watch	0

and	0
my	0
impatience	0
was	0
such	0
that	0
i	0
dare	0
say	0
it	0
really	0
was	0
little	0
more	0
than	0
a	0
quarter	0
of	0
that	0
time	0
.	0
then	0
i	0
rose	0
,	0
removed	0
my	0

took	0
my	0

through	0

was	0
not	0
more	0
than	0
thirty	0
feet	0
that	0
i	0
had	0
to	0
go	0

i	0
went	0

for	0
the	0

,	0
very	0
slowly	0
i	0
felt	0
my	0
way	0
along	0

a	0
yellow	0

now	1
i	1
was	1
left	1
with	1
a	1
difficult	1
point	1
to	1
settle	1
,	1
for	1
it	1
was	1
hard	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
say	1
whether	1
it	1
was	1
better	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
do	1
that	1

i	1
might	1

in	1

my	1

i	1
was	1
sure	1
that	1

him	1

knew	1
your	1

i	1
was	1

i	1
both	1
could	1

when	1

had	1
been	1
hounded	1
from	1
his	1

from	1

would	1
be	1
time	1

for	1

motionless	1

spasm	1

terror	1

,	1
catching	1
up	1

that	1
in	1
my	1
mad	1
haste	1

carried	1
away	1

not	1
the	1
hunting-knife	1
which	1

taken	1
with	1
me	1

the	1

concealed	1

my	1
fears	1
would	1
not	1
allow	1
me	1
to	1
go	1
back	1
for	1
the	1
other	1
,	1
as	1
i	1
might	1
perhaps	1
have	1
done	1
,	1
had	1
i	1
foreseen	1
how	1
terribly	1
its	1
presence	1

a	1

that	1
that	1
would	1

tell	1
all	1
this	1
without	1
revealing	1
the	1
family	1
scandal	1

he	1
was	1
so	1
anxious	1
to	1
conceal	1
?	1
i	1

that	1
at	1
the	1
beginning	1
i	1
did	1
not	1
tell	1
him	1
what	1
i	1
had	1
seen	1
,	1
and	1
my	1
excuse	1
must	1
be	1
that	1
he	1
disappeared	1
before	1

had	1
time	1
to	1
determine	1
what	1
i	1
should	1
do	1

swore	1
that	1
if	1
ever	1
i	1
should	1
find	1
my	1
old	1
master	1
,	1
i	1
should	1
reveal	1
everything	1
to	1
him	1

the	1
chance	1
of	1
my	1
overhearing	1
a	1
story	1
told	1
by	1
young	1
mr.	1
stone	1
here	1
,	1
which	1
showed	1
me	1
that	1
some	1
one	1
was	1
using	1
the	1
secret	1
chambers	1
of	1
cliffe	1
royal	1
,	1
convinced	1
me	1
that	1
lord	1
avon	1
was	1
in	1
hiding	1
there	1
,	1
and	1
i	1
lost	1
no	1
time	1
in	1
seeking	1
him	1
out	1
and	1
offering	1
to	1
do	1
him	1
all	1
the	1
justice	1
in	1
my	1
power	1

but	1
it	1
would	1

if	1
i	1

to	1
sacrifice	1
a	1
frail	1
life	1

failing	1
health	1
in	1
a	1
cause	1
for	1
which	1
i	1
freely	1
surrendered	1
all	1
that	1
youth	1
had	1
to	1
offer	1
.	1
but	1
new	1
considerations	1
have	1
at	1

me	1
to	1

my	1
resolution	1

my	1
son	1

through	1
ignorance	1

that	1

that	1
my	1
death	1

cast	1
a	1
