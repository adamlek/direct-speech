if	1

mr.	1

better	1
to	1

yourself	1

fall	1
into	1
a	1
sort	1
of	1
dream	1

sometimes	1
i	1
think	1
i	1
am	1
in	1
northumberland	1

and	1
that	1
the	1
noises	1
i	1
hear	1
round	1

are	1
the	1
bubbling	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
brook	1

runs	1
through	1

you	1

mere	1
chance	1

the	1

this	1
afternoon	1

instead	1
of	1
dreaming	1

i	1
was	1
wondering	1
how	1
a	1
man	1
who	1
wished	1
to	1
do	1
right	1
could	1
act	1
so	1
unjustly	1
and	1
unwisely	1
as	1
charles	1
the	1
first	1
sometimes	1
did	1
;	1
and	1
i	1
thought	1
what	1
a	1
pity	1
it	1
was	1
that	1
,	1
with	1
his	1
integrity	1
and	1
conscientiousness	1
,	1
he	1
could	1
see	1
no	1
farther	1
than	1
the	1
prerogatives	1
of	1
the	1
crown	1
.	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
but	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
look	1
to	1
a	1
distance	1
,	1
and	1
see	1
how	1
what	1
they	1
call	1
the	1
spirit	1
of	1
the	1
age	1
was	1
tending	1
!	1
still	1
,	1
i	1
like	1
charles	1
--	1
i	1
respect	1
him	1
--	1
i	1
pity	1
him	1
,	1
poor	1
murdered	1
king	1
!	1
yes	1
,	1
his	1
enemies	1
were	1
the	1
worst	1
:	1
they	1
shed	1
blood	1
they	1
had	1
no	1
right	1
to	1
shed	1

how	1
dared	1
they	1
kill	1
him	1

no	1

something	1

with	1

you	1

yes	1

in	1

are	1

to	1
you	1

it	1
is	1
all	1
i	1
ever	1
desire	1
to	1
be	1

if	1
people	1
were	1
always	1
kind	1

obedient	1
to	1
those	1
who	1
are	1
cruel	1

unjust	1

the	1
wicked	1
people	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
all	1
their	1
own	1
way	1
:	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
feel	1
afraid	1

and	1
so	1
they	1
would	1
never	1
alter	1
,	1
but	1
would	1
grow	1
worse	1
and	1
worse	1
.	1
when	1
we	1
are	1
struck	1
at	1
without	1
a	1
reason	1
,	1
we	1
should	1
strike	1
back	1
again	1
very	1
hard	1
;	1
i	1
am	1
sure	1
we	1
should	1
--	1
so	1
hard	1
as	1
to	1
teach	1
the	1
person	1
who	1
struck	1
us	1
never	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
again	1
.	1

you	1
will	1
change	1
your	1
mind	1
,	1
i	1
hope	1
,	1
when	1
you	1
grow	1
older	1
:	1
as	1
yet	1
you	1
are	1
but	1
a	1
little	1
untaught	1
girl	1

but	1
i	1
feel	1
this	1
,	1
helen	1
;	1
i	1
must	1
dislike	1
those	1
who	1
,	1
whatever	1
i	1
do	1
to	1
please	1
them	1
,	1
persist	1
in	1
disliking	1
me	1
;	1
i	1
must	1
resist	1
those	1
who	1
punish	1
me	1
unjustly	1
.	1
it	1
is	1
as	1
natural	1
as	1
that	1
i	1
should	1
love	1
those	1
who	1
show	1
me	1
affection	1
,	1
or	1
submit	1
to	1
punishment	1
when	1
i	1
feel	1
it	1
is	1
deserved	1
.	1

heathens	1
and	1
savage	1
tribes	1
hold	1
that	1
doctrine	1
,	1
but	1
christians	1
and	1
civilised	1
nations	1
disown	1
it	1
.	1

how	1
?	1
i	1
do	1
n't	1
understand	1
.	1

it	1
is	1
not	1
violence	1
that	1
best	1
overcomes	1
hate	1
--	1
nor	1
vengeance	1
that	1
most	1
certainly	1
heals	1
injury	1
.	1

what	1
then	1
?	1

read	1
the	1
new	1
testament	1
,	1
and	1
observe	1
what	1
christ	1
says	1
,	1
and	1
how	1
he	1
acts	1
;	1
make	1
his	1
word	1
your	1
rule	1
,	1
and	1
his	1
conduct	1
your	1
example	1

what	1
does	1
he	1
say	1
?	1

love	1
your	1
enemies	1

bless	1
them	1
that	1

you	1

you	1

an	1

not	1

neglected	1

still	1
it	1

a	1
respectable	1

you	1
know	1
in	1
winter-time	1
one	1
feels	1
dreary	1
quite	1
alone	1
in	1
the	1

alone	1

leah	1

a	1

and	1
john	1

his	1

then	1
you	1
see	1
they	1
are	1
only	1
servants	1

and	1
one	1
ca	1
n't	1
converse	1
with	1
them	1

terms	1
of	1
equality	1

one	1
must	1
keep	1
them	1

fear	1
of	1
losing	1
one	1
's	1
authority	1

i	1
'm	1
sure	1
last	1
winter	1

it	1

a	1
very	1
severe	1
one	1

when	1
it	1

not	1
snow	1

came	1
to	1
the	1
house	1

from	1
november	1

february	1

i	1
really	1
got	1
quite	1
melancholy	1

i	1
had	1
leah	1
in	1
to	1

me	1
sometimes	1
;	1

i	1
do	1
n't	1

it	1

easy	1

nothing	1

you	1

when	1

can	1
not	1
be	1
always	1
sure	1
whether	1

yes	1

the	1
present	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
has	1
not	1
been	1
very	1
long	1
in	1
possession	1
of	1
the	1
property	1
;	1
only	1
about	1
nine	1
years	1
.	1

nine	1
years	1
is	1
a	1
tolerable	1
time	1
.	1
was	1
he	1
so	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
as	1
to	1
be	1
still	1
inconsolable	1
for	1
his	1
loss	1
?	1

why	1
,	1
no	1
--	1
perhaps	1
not	1
.	1
i	1
believe	1
there	1
were	1
some	1
misunderstandings	1
between	1
them	1
.	1
mr.	1
rowland	1
rochester	1
was	1
not	1
quite	1
just	1
to	1
mr.	1
edward	1
;	1
and	1
perhaps	1
he	1
prejudiced	1
his	1
father	1
against	1
him	1
.	1
the	1
old	1
gentleman	1
was	1
fond	1
of	1
money	1
,	1
and	1
anxious	1
to	1
keep	1
the	1
family	1
estate	1
together	1
.	1
he	1
did	1
not	1
like	1
to	1
diminish	1
the	1
property	1
by	1
division	1
,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
anxious	1
that	1
mr.	1
edward	1
should	1
have	1
wealth	1
,	1
too	1
,	1
to	1
keep	1
up	1
the	1
consequence	1
of	1
the	1
name	1
;	1
and	1
,	1
soon	1
after	1
he	1
was	1
of	1
age	1
,	1
some	1
steps	1
were	1
taken	1
that	1
were	1
not	1
quite	1
fair	1
,	1
and	1
made	1
a	1
great	1
deal	1
of	1
mischief	1
.	1
old	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
and	1
mr.	1
rowland	1
combined	1
to	1
bring	1
mr.	1
edward	1
into	1
what	1
he	1
considered	1
a	1
painful	1
position	1
,	1
for	1
the	1
sake	1
of	1
making	1
his	1
fortune	1
:	1
what	1
the	1
precise	1
nature	1
of	1
that	1
position	1
was	1
i	1
never	1
clearly	1
knew	1
,	1
but	1
his	1
spirit	1
could	1
not	1
brook	1
what	1
he	1
had	1
to	1
suffer	1
in	1
it	1
.	1
he	1
is	1
not	1
very	1
forgiving	1
:	1
he	1
broke	1
with	1
his	1
family	1
,	1
and	1
now	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
he	1
has	1
led	1
an	1
unsettled	1
kind	1
of	1
life	1
.	1
i	1
do	1
n't	1
think	1
he	1
has	1
ever	1
been	1
resident	1
at	1
thornfield	1
for	1
a	1
fortnight	1
together	1
,	1
since	1
the	1
death	1
of	1
his	1
brother	1
without	1
a	1
will	1
left	1
him	1
master	1
of	1
the	1
estate	1
;	1
and	1
,	1
indeed	1
,	1
no	1
wonder	1
he	1
shuns	1
the	1
old	1
place	1
.	1

why	1
should	1
he	1
shun	1
it	1
?	1

perhaps	1
he	1
thinks	1
it	1
gloomy	1
.	1

the	0

was	0
evasive	0

out	0

to	0

gone	1

not	1

ten	1
miles	1
on	1

i	1
believe	1
there	1
is	1
quite	1
a	1
party	1
assembled	1
there	1
;	1
lord	1

,	1
sir	1
george	1

do	1
you	1
expect	1
him	1
back	1
to-night	1
?	1

no	1
--	1
nor	1
to-morrow	1
either	1
;	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
he	1
is	1
very	1
likely	1
to	1
stay	1
a	1
week	1
or	1
more	1
:	1
when	1
these	1
fine	1
,	1
fashionable	1
people	1
get	1
together	1
,	1
they	1
are	1
so	1
surrounded	1
by	1
elegance	1
and	1
gaiety	1
,	1
so	1
well	1
provided	1
with	1
all	1
that	1
can	1
please	1
and	1
entertain	1
,	1
they	1
are	1
in	1
no	1
hurry	1
to	1
separate	1
.	1
gentlemen	1
especially	1
are	1
often	1
in	1
request	1
on	1
such	1
occasions	1
;	1
and	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
is	1
so	1
talented	1
and	1
so	1
lively	1
in	1
society	1
,	1
that	1
i	1
believe	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
general	1
favourite	1
:	1
the	1
ladies	1
are	1
very	1
fond	1
of	1
him	1
;	1
though	1
you	1
would	1
not	1
think	1
his	1
appearance	1
calculated	1
to	1
recommend	1
him	1
particularly	1
in	1
their	1
eyes	1
:	1
but	1
i	1
suppose	1
his	1
acquirements	1
and	1
abilities	1
,	1
perhaps	1
his	1
wealth	1
and	1
good	1
blood	1
,	1
make	1
amends	1
for	1
any	1
little	1
fault	1
of	1
look	1
.	1

are	1
there	1
ladies	1
at	1
the	1
leas	1
?	1

there	1
are	1
mrs.	1
eshton	1
and	1
her	1
three	1
daughters	1
--	1
very	1
elegant	1
young	1
ladies	1
indeed	1
;	1
and	1
there	1
are	1
the	1
honourable	1
blanche	1
and	1
mary	1
ingram	1
,	1
most	1
beautiful	1
women	1
,	1
i	1
suppose	1
:	1
indeed	1
i	1
have	1
seen	1
blanche	1
,	1
six	1
or	1
seven	1
years	1
since	1
,	1
when	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
girl	1
of	1
eighteen	1
.	1
she	1
came	1
here	1
to	1
a	1
christmas	1
ball	1
and	1
party	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
gave	1
.	1
you	1
should	1
have	1
seen	1
the	1
dining-room	1
that	1
day	1
--	1
how	1
richly	1
it	1
was	1
decorated	1
,	1
how	1
brilliantly	1
lit	1
up	1
!	1
i	1
should	1
think	1
there	1
were	1
fifty	1
ladies	1
and	1
gentlemen	1
present	1
--	1
all	1
of	1
the	1
first	1
county	1
families	1
;	1
and	1
miss	1
ingram	1
was	1
considered	1
the	1
belle	1
of	1
the	1
evening	1
.	1

you	1
saw	1
her	1
,	1
you	1
say	1
,	1
mrs.	1
fairfax	1
:	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
like	1
?	1

yes	1
,	1
i	1
saw	1
her	1
.	1
the	1
dining-room	1
doors	1
were	1
thrown	1
open	1
;	1
and	1
,	1
as	1
it	1
was	1
christmas-time	1
,	1
the	1
servants	1
were	1
allowed	1
to	1
assemble	1
in	1
the	1
hall	1
,	1
to	1
hear	1
some	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
sing	1
and	1
play	1
.	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
would	1
have	1
me	1
to	1
come	1
in	1
,	1
and	1
i	1
sat	1
down	1
in	1
a	1
quiet	1
corner	1
and	1
watched	1
them	1
.	1
i	1
never	1
saw	1
a	1
more	1
splendid	1
scene	1
:	1
the	1
ladies	1
were	1
magnificently	1
dressed	1
;	1
most	1
of	1
them	1
--	1
at	1
least	1
most	1
of	1
the	1
younger	1
ones	1
--	1
looked	1
handsome	1
;	1
but	1
miss	1
ingram	1
was	1
certainly	1
the	1
queen	1
.	1

and	1
what	1
was	1
she	1
like	1
?	1

tall	1
,	1
fine	1
bust	1
,	1
sloping	1
shoulders	1
;	1
long	1
,	1
graceful	1
neck	1
:	1
olive	1
complexion	1
,	1
dark	1
and	1
clear	1
;	1
noble	1
features	1
;	1
eyes	1
rather	1
like	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
's	1
:	1
large	1
and	1
black	1
,	1
and	1
as	1
brilliant	1
as	1
her	1
jewels	1
.	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
had	1
such	1
a	1
fine	1
head	1
of	1
hair	1
;	1
raven-black	1
and	1
so	1
becomingly	1
arranged	1
:	1
a	1
crown	1
of	1
thick	1
plaits	1
behind	1
,	1
and	1
in	1
front	1
the	1
longest	1
,	1
the	1
glossiest	1
curls	1
i	1
ever	1
saw	1
.	1
she	1
was	1
dressed	1
in	1
pure	1
white	1
;	1
an	1
amber-coloured	1
scarf	1
was	1
passed	1
over	1
her	1
shoulder	1
and	1
across	1
her	1
breast	1
,	1
tied	1
at	1
the	1
side	1
,	1
and	1
descending	1
in	1
long	1
,	1
fringed	1
ends	1
below	1
her	1
knee	1
.	1
she	1
wore	1
an	1
amber-coloured	1
flower	1
,	1
too	1
,	1
in	1
her	1
hair	1
:	1
it	1
contrasted	1
well	1
with	1
the	1
jetty	1
mass	1
of	1
her	1
curls	1
.	1

she	1
was	1
greatly	1
admired	1
,	1
of	1
course	1
?	1

yes	1
,	1
indeed	1
:	1
and	1
not	1
only	1
for	1
her	1
beauty	1
,	1
but	1
for	1
her	1
accomplishments	1
.	1
she	1
was	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
ladies	1
who	1
sang	1
:	1
a	1
gentleman	1
accompanied	1
her	1
on	1
the	1
piano	1
.	1
she	1
and	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
sang	1
a	1
duet	1
.	1

mr.	1
rochester	1
?	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
aware	1
he	1
could	1
sing	1
.	1

oh	1
!	1
he	1
has	1
a	1
fine	1
bass	1
voice	1
,	1
and	1
an	1
excellent	1
taste	1
for	1
music	1
.	1

and	1
miss	1
ingram	1
:	1
what	1
sort	1
of	1
a	1
voice	1
had	1
she	1
?	1

a	1
very	1
rich	1
and	1
powerful	1
one	1
:	1
she	1
sang	1
delightfully	1
;	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
treat	1
to	1
listen	1
to	1
her	1
;	1
--	1
and	1
she	1
played	1
afterwards	1
.	1
i	1
am	1
no	1
judge	1
of	1
music	1
,	1
but	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
is	1
;	1
and	1
i	1
heard	1
him	1
say	1
her	1
execution	1
was	1
remarkably	1
good	1
.	1

and	1
this	1
beautiful	1
and	1
accomplished	1
lady	1
,	1
she	1
is	1
not	1
yet	1
married	1
?	1

it	1
appears	1
not	1
:	1
i	1
fancy	1
neither	1
she	1
nor	1
her	1
sister	1
have	1
very	1
large	1
fortunes	1
.	1
old	1
lord	1
ingram	1
's	1
estates	1
were	1
chiefly	1
entailed	1
,	1
and	1
the	1
eldest	1
son	1
came	1
in	1
for	1
everything	1
almost	1
.	1

but	1
i	1
wonder	1
no	1
wealthy	1
nobleman	1
or	1
gentleman	1
has	1
taken	1
a	1
fancy	1
to	1
her	1
:	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
,	1
for	1
instance	1
.	1
he	1
is	1
rich	1
,	1
is	1
he	1
not	1
?	1

oh	1
!	1
yes	1
.	1
but	1
you	1
see	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
considerable	1
difference	1
in	1
age	1
:	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
is	1
nearly	1
forty	1
;	1
she	1
is	1
but	1
twenty-five	1
.	1

what	1
of	1
that	1
?	1
more	1
unequal	1
matches	1
are	1
made	1
every	1
day	1

true	1
:	1
yet	1
i	1
should	1
scarcely	1
fancy	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
would	1
entertain	1
an	1
idea	1
of	1
the	1
sort	1

but	1
you	1

nothing	1

scarcely	1

yesterday	1
i	1
trusted	1
well	1
in	1

believed	1
that	1

were	1
working	1
together	1
for	1
your	1

mine	1
:	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fine	1
day	1
,	1
if	1
you	1
recollect	1
--	1
the	1
calmness	1
of	1
the	1
air	1

sky	1
forbade	1
apprehensions	1
respecting	1
your	1
safety	1
or	1
comfort	1
on	1
your	1
journey	1
.	1
i	1
walked	1
a	1
little	1
while	1
on	1
the	1
pavement	1
after	1
tea	1
,	1
thinking	1
of	1
you	1
;	1
and	1
i	1
beheld	1
you	1
in	1
imagination	1
so	1
near	1
me	1
,	1
i	1
scarcely	1
missed	1
your	1
actual	1
presence	1
.	1
i	1
thought	1
of	1
the	1
life	1
that	1
lay	1
before	1
me	1
--	1
your	1
life	1
,	1
sir	1
--	1
an	1
existence	1
more	1
expansive	1
and	1
stirring	1
than	1
my	1
own	1
:	1
as	1
much	1
more	1
so	1
as	1
the	1
depths	1
of	1
the	1
sea	1
to	1
which	1
the	1
brook	1
runs	1
are	1
than	1
the	1
shallows	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
strait	1
channel	1
.	1
i	1
wondered	1
why	1
moralists	1
call	1
this	1
world	1
a	1
dreary	1
wilderness	1
:	1
for	1
me	1
it	1
blossomed	1
like	1
a	1
rose	1
.	1
just	1
at	1
sunset	1
,	1
the	1
air	1
turned	1
cold	1
and	1
the	1
sky	1
cloudy	1
:	1
i	1
went	1
in	1
,	1
sophie	1
called	1
me	1
upstairs	1
to	1
look	1
at	1
my	1
wedding-dress	1
,	1
which	1
they	1
had	1
just	1
brought	1
;	1
and	1
under	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
box	1
i	1
found	1
your	1
present	1
--	1
the	1
veil	1
which	1
,	1
in	1
your	1
princely	1
extravagance	1
,	1
you	1
sent	1
for	1
from	1
london	1
:	1
resolved	1
,	1
i	1
suppose	1
,	1
since	1
i	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
jewels	1
,	1
to	1
cheat	1
me	1
into	1
accepting	1
something	1
as	1
costly	1
.	1
i	1
smiled	1
as	1
i	1
unfolded	1
it	1
,	1
and	1
devised	1
how	1
i	1
would	1
tease	1
you	1
about	1
your	1
aristocratic	1
tastes	1
,	1
and	1
your	1
efforts	1
to	1
masque	1
your	1
plebeian	1
bride	1
in	1
the	1
attributes	1
of	1
a	1
peeress	1

i	1
thought	1
how	1
i	1
would	1
carry	1
down	1
to	1
you	1
the	1
square	1
of	1
unembroidered	1
blond	1
i	1
had	1
myself	1
prepared	1
as	1
a	1
covering	1
for	1
my	1
low-born	1
head	1
,	1
and	1
ask	1
if	1
that	1
was	1
not	1
good	1
enough	1
for	1
a	1
woman	1
who	1
could	1
bring	1
her	1
husband	1
neither	1
fortune	1
,	1
beauty	1
,	1
nor	1
connections	1
.	1
i	1
saw	1
plainly	1
how	1
you	1
would	1
look	1
;	1
and	1
heard	1
your	1
impetuous	1
republican	1
answers	1
,	1
and	1
your	1
haughty	1
disavowal	1
of	1
any	1
necessity	1
on	1
your	1
part	1
to	1
augment	1
your	1
wealth	1
,	1
or	1
elevate	1
your	1
standing	1

by	1
marrying	1
either	1
a	1
purse	1
or	1
a	1
coronet	1

what	1
did	1
you	1
find	1
in	1
the	1

did	1
you	1
find	1
poison	1

a	1

that	1
you	1

so	1
mournful	1
now	1

sir	1
;	1
besides	1
the	1
delicacy	1
and	1
richness	1
of	1
the	1
fabric	1

i	1
found	1
nothing	1
save	1
fairfax	1
rochester	1

pride	1

and	1
that	1
did	1
not	1

wild	1

high	1

'with	1
a	1
sullen	1

i	1
wished	1
you	1
were	1
at	1

came	1
into	1
this	1
room	1

and	1
the	1
sight	1
of	1
the	1
empty	1
chair	1

fireless	1
hearth	1
chilled	1
me	1

for	1
some	1
time	1
after	1
i	1
went	1
to	1
bed	1
,	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
sleep	1
--	1
a	1
sense	1
of	1
anxious	1
excitement	1
distressed	1
me	1
.	1
the	1
gale	1
still	1
rising	1
,	1
seemed	1
to	1
my	1
ear	1
to	1
muffle	1
a	1
mournful	1
under-sound	1
;	1
whether	1
in	1
the	1
house	1
or	1
abroad	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
at	1
first	1
tell	1

but	1
it	1
recurred	1
,	1
doubtful	1
yet	1
doleful	1
at	1
every	1
lull	1
;	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
made	1
out	1
it	1
must	1
be	1
some	1
dog	1
howling	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
.	1
i	1
was	1
glad	1
when	1
it	1
ceased	1
.	1
on	1
sleeping	1
,	1
i	1
continued	1
in	1
dreams	1
the	1
idea	1
of	1
a	1
dark	1
and	1
gusty	1
night	1
.	1
i	1
continued	1
also	1
the	1
wish	1
to	1
be	1
with	1
you	1
,	1
and	1
experienced	1
a	1
strange	1
,	1
regretful	1
consciousness	1
of	1
some	1
barrier	1
dividing	1
us	1
.	1
during	1
all	1
my	1
first	1
sleep	1
,	1
i	1
was	1
following	1
the	1
windings	1
of	1
an	1
unknown	1
road	1
;	1
total	1
obscurity	1
environed	1
me	1
;	1
rain	1
pelted	1
me	1
;	1
i	1
was	1
burdened	1
with	1
the	1
charge	1
of	1
a	1
little	1
child	1
:	1
a	1
very	1
small	1
creature	1
,	1
too	1
young	1
and	1
feeble	1
to	1
walk	1
,	1
and	1
which	1
shivered	1
in	1
my	1
cold	1
arms	1
,	1
and	1
wailed	1
piteously	1
in	1
my	1
ear	1
.	1
i	1
thought	1
,	1
sir	1
,	1
that	1
you	1
were	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
a	1
long	1
way	1
before	1
me	1

and	1
i	1
strained	1
every	1
nerve	1
to	1
overtake	1
you	1

and	1
made	1
effort	1
on	1
effort	1
to	1
utter	1
your	1
name	1
and	1
entreat	1
you	1
to	1
stop	1

but	1
my	1
movements	1
were	1
fettered	1

and	1
my	1
voice	1
still	1
died	1
away	1
inarticulate	1

farther	1

much	1
its	1

must	1
retain	1

i	1
heard	1
the	1
gallop	1
of	1
a	1
horse	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
on	1
the	1
road	1
;	1
i	1
was	1
sure	1
it	1
was	1
you	1

and	1
you	1
were	1
departing	1
for	1
many	1
years	1
and	1
for	1
a	1
distant	1
country	1
.	1
i	1
climbed	1
the	1
thin	1
wall	1
with	1
frantic	1
perilous	1
haste	1
,	1
eager	1
to	1
catch	1
one	1
glimpse	1
of	1
you	1
from	1
the	1
top	1
:	1
the	1
stones	1
rolled	1
from	1
under	1
my	1
feet	1

the	1
ivy	1

grasped	1
gave	1
way	1
,	1
the	1
child	1
clung	1
round	1
my	1
neck	1
in	1
terror	1
,	1
and	1
almost	1
strangled	1
me	1
;	1
at	1
last	1
i	1
gained	1
the	1
summit	1
.	1
i	1
saw	1
you	1
like	1
a	1
speck	1
on	1
a	1
white	1
track	1
,	1
lessening	1
every	1
moment	1

the	1
blast	1
blew	1
so	1
strong	1
i	1
could	1
not	1
stand	1

i	1
sat	1
down	1
on	1
the	1
narrow	1
ledge	1
;	1
i	1
hushed	1
the	1
scared	1
infant	1
in	1
my	1
lap	1
:	1
you	1
turned	1
an	1
angle	1
of	1
the	1
road	1
:	1
i	1
bent	1
forward	1
to	1
take	1
a	1
last	1
look	1

the	1
wall	1
crumbled	1

i	1
was	1
shaken	1

the	1
child	1
rolled	1
from	1
my	1
knee	1

lost	1
my	1
balance	1

fell	1

it	1
more	1

be	1
loved	1

never	1

then	1
took	1
a	1
drop	1
over-much	1
.	1
it	1
is	1
excusable	1
,	1
for	1
she	1
had	1
a	1
hard	1
life	1
of	1
it	1
:	1
but	1
still	1
it	1
was	1
dangerous	1
;	1
for	1
when	1
mrs.	1
poole	1
was	1
fast	1
asleep	1
after	1
the	1
gin	1
and	1
water	1
,	1
the	1
mad	1
lady	1
,	1
who	1
was	1
as	1
cunning	1
as	1
a	1
witch	1
,	1
would	1
take	1
the	1
keys	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
pocket	1
,	1
let	1
herself	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
chamber	1
,	1
and	1
go	1
roaming	1
about	1
the	1
house	1
,	1
doing	1
any	1
wild	1
mischief	1
that	1
came	1
into	1
her	1
head	1
.	1
they	1
say	1
she	1
had	1
nearly	1
burnt	1
her	1
husband	1
in	1
his	1
bed	1
once	1
:	1
but	1
i	1
do	1
n't	1
know	1
about	1
that	1
.	1
however	1
,	1
on	1
this	1
night	1
,	1
she	1
set	1
fire	1
first	1
to	1
the	1
hangings	1
of	1
the	1
room	1
next	1
her	1
own	1
,	1
and	1
then	1
she	1
got	1
down	1
to	1
a	1
lower	1
storey	1
,	1
and	1
made	1
her	1
way	1
to	1
the	1
chamber	1
that	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
governess	1
's	1
--	1
(	1
she	1
was	1
like	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
knew	1
somehow	1
how	1
matters	1
had	1
gone	1
on	1
,	1
and	1
had	1
a	1
spite	1
at	1
her	1
)	1
--	1
and	1
she	1
kindled	1
the	1
bed	1
there	1
;	1
but	1
there	1
was	1
nobody	1
sleeping	1
in	1
it	1
,	1
fortunately	1
.	1
the	1
governess	1
had	1
run	1
away	1
two	1
months	1
before	1
;	1
and	1
for	1
all	1
mr.	1
rochester	1
sought	1
her	1
as	1
if	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
the	1
most	1
precious	1
thing	1
he	1
had	1
in	1
the	1
world	1
,	1
he	1
never	1
could	1
hear	1
a	1
word	1
of	1
her	1
;	1
and	1
he	1
grew	1
savage	1
--	1
quite	1
savage	1
on	1
his	1
disappointment	1
:	1
he	1
never	1
was	1
a	1
wild	1
man	1
,	1
but	1
he	1
got	1
dangerous	1
after	1
he	1
lost	1
her	1
.	1
he	1
would	1
be	1
alone	1
,	1
too	1
.	1
he	1
sent	1
mrs.	1
fairfax	1
,	1
the	1
housekeeper	1
,	1
away	1
to	1
her	1
friends	1
at	1
a	1
distance	1
;	1
but	1
he	1
did	1
it	1
handsomely	1
,	1
for	1
he	1
settled	1
an	1
annuity	1
on	1
her	1
for	1
life	1
:	1
and	1
she	1
deserved	1
it	1
--	1
she	1
was	1
a	1
very	1
good	1
woman	1
.	1
miss	1
adele	1
,	1
a	1
ward	1
he	1
had	1
,	1
was	1
put	1
to	1
school	1
.	1
he	1
broke	1
off	1
acquaintance	1
with	1
all	1
the	1
gentry	1
,	1
and	1
shut	1
himself	1
up	1
like	1
a	1
hermit	1
at	1
the	1
hall	1
.	1

what	1

did	1
he	1
not	1
leave	1
england	1
?	1

leave	1
england	1
?	1
bless	1
you	1

no	1
!	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
cross	1
the	1
door-stones	1
of	1
the	1
house	1
,	1
except	1
at	1
night	1
,	1
when	1
he	1
walked	1
just	1
like	1
a	1
ghost	1
about	1
the	1
grounds	1
and	1
in	1
the	1
orchard	1
as	1
if	1
he	1
had	1
lost	1
his	1
senses	1
--	1
which	1
it	1
is	1
my	1
opinion	1
he	1
had	1
;	1
for	1
a	1
more	1
spirited	1
,	1
bolder	1
,	1
keener	1
gentleman	1
than	1
he	1
was	1
before	1

of	1
a	1

crossed	1
him	1
,	1
you	1
never	1

ma'am	1

he	1
was	1
not	1
a	1

to	1
wine	1
,	1
or	1
cards	1
,	1
or	1
racing	1
,	1
as	1
some	1
are	1
,	1
and	1
he	1
was	1
not	1
so	1
very	1
handsome	1
;	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
a	1
courage	1
and	1
a	1
will	1
of	1
his	1
own	1
,	1
if	1
ever	1
man	1

from	1
a	1

you	1

for	1
my	1

i	1
have	1
often	1
wished	1

been	1
sunk	1
in	1

before	1
she	1
came	1

mr.	1

was	1
at	1

broke	1
out	1

yes	1

indeed	1
was	1
he	1
;	1

he	1
went	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
attics	1
when	1
all	1
was	1
burning	1
above	1

below	1

and	1
got	1
the	1
servants	1
out	1
of	1
their	1
beds	1
and	1
helped	1
them	1
down	1
himself	1
,	1
and	1
went	1
back	1
to	1
get	1
his	1
mad	1
wife	1
out	1
of	1
her	1
cell	1
.	1
and	1
then	1
they	1
called	1
out	1
to	1
him	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
on	1
the	1
roof	1
,	1
where	1
she	1
was	1
standing	1
,	1
waving	1
her	1
arms	1

above	1
the	1

and	1
shouting	1
out	1
till	1
they	1
could	1

her	1
a	1

saw	1
her	1

her	1
with	1
my	1

was	1
a	1
big	1
woman	1

had	1
long	1
