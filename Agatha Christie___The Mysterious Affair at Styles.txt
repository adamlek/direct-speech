in	1

at	1

hardly	1

the	1

speaking	1
very	1

clear	1

i	1
heard	1
what	1

plainly	1

'you	1

lied	1
to	1

did	1
n't	1

he	1
spoke	1
a	1
good	1

she	1
did	1
--	1

she	1
answered	1
:	1
'how	1
dare	1
you	1

i	1
was	1
now	1
quite	1
convinced	1

made	1
a	1
fresh	1
will	1

had	1
called	1
the	1

possibly	1

strychnine	1
is	1
a	1
fairly	1
rapid	1
drug	1
in	1
its	1
action	1

from	1
one	1
to	1
two	1
hours	1

appear	1
to	1
have	1

present	1
in	1
this	1
case	1

i	1
presume	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
took	1
the	1
coffee	1
after	1
dinner	1
about	1
eight	1
o'clock	1
,	1
whereas	1
the	1
symptoms	1
did	1
not	1
manifest	1
themselves	1
until	1
the	1
early	1
hours	1
of	1
the	1
morning	1
,	1
which	1
,	1
on	1
the	1
face	1
of	1
it	1
,	1
points	1
to	1
the	1
drug	1
having	1
been	1
taken	1
much	1
later	1
in	1
the	1
evening	1
.	1

mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
was	1
in	1
the	1
habit	1
of	1
drinking	1
a	1
cup	1
of	1
coco	1
in	1
the	1
middle	1
of	1
the	1
night	1
.	1
could	1
the	1
strychnine	1
have	1
been	1
administered	1
in	1
that	1
?	1

no	1
,	1
i	1
myself	1
took	1
a	1
sample	1
of	1
the	1
coco	1
remaining	1
in	1
the	1
saucepan	1
and	1
had	1
it	1
analysed	1
.	1
there	1
was	1
no	1
strychnine	1
present	1
.	1

i	0
heard	0
poirot	0
chuckle	0
softly	0
beside	0
me	0
.	0

how	1
did	1
you	1
know	1
?	1
i	0
whispered	0
.	0

listen	1
.	1

i	1
should	1
say	1
--	0
the	0
doctor	0
was	0
continuing	0
--	0
that	1
i	1
would	1
have	1
been	1
considerably	1
surprised	1
at	1
any	1
other	1
result	1
.	1

why	1
?	1

simply	1
because	1
strychnine	1
has	1
an	1
unusually	1
bitter	1
taste	1
.	1
it	1
can	1
be	1
detected	1
in	1
a	1
solution	1
of	1
1	1
in	1
70,000	1
,	1
and	1
can	1
only	1
be	1
disguised	1
by	1
some	1
strongly	1
flavoured	1
substance	1
.	1
coco	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
powerless	1
to	1
mask	1
it	1
.	1

one	0
of	0
the	0
jury	0
wanted	0
to	0
know	0
if	0
the	0
same	0
objection	0
applied	0
to	0
coffee	0
.	0

no	1
.	1
coffee	1
has	1
a	1
bitter	1
taste	1
of	1
its	1
own	1
which	1
would	1
probably	1
cover	1
the	1
taste	1
of	1
strychnine	1
.	1

then	1
you	1
consider	1
it	1
more	1
likely	1
that	1
the	1
drug	1
was	1
administered	1
in	1
the	1
coffee	1
,	1
but	1
that	1
for	1
some	1
unknown	1
reason	1
its	1
action	1

delayed	1

yes	1

,	1
the	1

my	1

at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death	1
,	1
and	1
for	1
some	1

was	1
taking	1

i	1
believe	1

continued	0

that	1
there	1
have	1
been	1
cases	1
where	1
the	1
cumulative	1
effect	1
of	1
a	1

administered	1
for	1
some	1

has	1
ended	1
by	1

also	1
,	1
is	1
it	1
not	1
possible	1
that	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
taken	1
an	1
overdose	1
of	1
her	1

this	1
is	1
the	1
first	1
we	1
have	1
heard	1
of	1
the	1
deceased	1
taking	1
strychnine	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
her	1
death	1

we	1
are	1
much	1
obliged	1
to	1
you	1

the	0

what	1
mr.	1

suggests	1
is	1
quite	1
impossible	1

any	1

would	1
tell	1
you	1
the	1
same	1
.	1
strychnine	1
is	1
,	1
in	1
a	1
certain	1
sense	1
,	1
a	1
cumulative	1
poison	1
,	1
but	1
it	1
would	1
be	1
quite	1
impossible	1
for	1
it	1
to	1
result	1
in	1
sudden	1
death	1
in	1
this	1
way	1
.	1
there	1
would	1
have	1
to	1
be	1
a	1
long	1
period	1
of	1
chronic	1
symptoms	1
which	1
would	1
at	1
once	1
have	1
attracted	1
my	1
attention	1
.	1
the	1
whole	1
thing	1
is	1
absurd	1
.	1

and	1
the	1
second	1
suggestion	1
?	1
that	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
may	1
have	1
inadvertently	1
taken	1
an	1
overdose	1
?	1

three	1
,	1
or	1
even	1
four	1
doses	1
,	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
resulted	1
in	1
death	1
.	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
always	1
had	1
an	1
extra	1
large	1
amount	1
of	1
medicine	1
made	1
up	1
at	1
a	1
time	1
,	1
as	1
she	1
dealt	1
with	1
coot	1
's	1
,	1
the	1
cash	1
chemists	1
in	1
tadminster	1
.	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
to	1
take	1
very	1
nearly	1
the	1
whole	1
bottle	1
to	1
account	1
for	1
the	1
amount	1
of	1
strychnine	1
found	1
at	1
the	1
post-mortem	1
.	1

then	1
you	1
consider	1
that	1
we	1
may	1
dismiss	1
the	1
tonic	1
as	1
not	1
being	1
in	1
any	1
way	1
instrumental	1
in	1
causing	1
her	1
death	1
?	1

certainly	1

the	1
supposition	1

caught	1
in	1
the	1

between	1
that	1

the	1
adjoining	1

occupied	1
by	1

i	1
handed	1
the	1
fragment	1
over	1
to	1
the	1

who	1
did	1
not	1
consider	1
it	1
of	1
much	1
importance	1
.	1
nor	1
did	1
they	1
recognize	1
it	1
for	1
what	1
it	1
was	1
--	1
a	1
piece	1
torn	1
from	1
a	1

was	0

person	1
at	1

who	1
worked	1
on	1
the	1
land	1
--	1
mrs.	1

therefore	1
it	1
must	1
have	1
been	1
mrs.	1

who	1
entered	1

when	1
i	1

the	1

yes	1

but	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
place	1
we	1
have	1
only	1
her	1
word	1
for	1
it	1
,	1
since	1
it	1
was	1
she	1
who	1
tried	1
that	1
particular	1
door	1
and	1
reported	1
it	1
fastened	1
.	1
in	1
the	1
ensuing	1
confusion	1
she	1
would	1
have	1
had	1
ample	1
opportunity	1
to	1
shoot	1
the	1
bolt	1
across	1
.	1
i	1
took	1
an	1
early	1
opportunity	1
of	1
verifying	1
my	1
conjectures	1
.	1
to	1
begin	1
with	1
,	1
the	1
fragment	1
corresponds	1
exactly	1
with	1
a	1
tear	1
in	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
's	1
armlet	1
.	1
also	1
,	1
at	1
the	1
inquest	1
,	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
heard	1
,	1
from	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
,	1
the	1
fall	1
of	1
the	1
table	1
by	1
the	1
bed	1
.	1
i	1
took	1
an	1
early	1
opportunity	1
of	1
testing	1
that	1
statement	1
by	1
stationing	1
my	1
friend	1
monsieur	1
hastings	1
in	1
the	1
left	1
wing	1
of	1
the	1
building	1
,	1
just	1
outside	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
's	1
door	1
.	1
i	1
myself	1
,	1
in	1
company	1
with	1
the	1
police	1
,	1
went	1
to	1
the	1
deceased	1
's	1
room	1
,	1
and	1
whilst	1
there	1
i	1
,	1
apparently	1
accidentally	1
,	1
knocked	1
over	1
the	1
table	1
in	1
question	1
,	1
but	1
found	1
that	1
,	1
as	1
i	1
had	1
expected	1
,	1
monsieur	1
hastings	1
had	1
heard	1
no	1
sound	1
at	1
all	1
.	1
this	1
confirmed	1
my	1
belief	1
that	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
was	1
not	1
speaking	1
the	1
truth	1
when	1
she	1
declared	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
been	1
dressing	1
in	1
her	1
room	1
at	1
the	1
time	1
of	1
the	1
tragedy	1
.	1
in	1
fact	1
,	1
i	1
was	1
convinced	1
that	1
,	1
far	1
from	1
having	1
been	1
in	1
her	1
own	1
room	1
,	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
was	1
actually	1
in	1
the	1
deceased	1
's	1
room	1
when	1
the	1
alarm	1
was	1
given	1

at	0

very	0
pale	0

i	1
proceeded	1
to	1
reason	1
on	1
that	1
assumption	1
.	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
is	1
in	1
her	1
mother-in-law	1
's	1
room	1
.	1
we	1
will	1
say	1
that	1
she	1
is	1
seeking	1
for	1
something	1
and	1
has	1
not	1
yet	1
found	1
it	1
.	1
suddenly	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
awakens	1
and	1
is	1
seized	1
with	1
an	1
alarming	1
paroxysm	1
.	1
she	1
flings	1
out	1
her	1
arm	1
,	1
overturning	1
the	1
bed	1
table	1
,	1
and	1
then	1
pulls	1
desperately	1
at	1
the	1
bell	1
.	1
mrs.	1
cavendish	1
,	1
startled	1
,	1
drops	1
her	1
candle	1
,	1
scattering	1
the	1
grease	1
on	1
the	1
carpet	1

she	1
picks	1
it	1
up	1
,	1
and	1
retreats	1
quickly	1
to	1
mademoiselle	1
cynthia	1
's	1
room	1
,	1
closing	1
the	1
door	1
behind	1
her	1
.	1
she	1
hurries	1
out	1
into	1
the	1
passage	1

for	1
the	1
servants	1

not	1
find	1
her	1
where	1
she	1

it	1

too	1
late	1

echoing	1
along	1
the	1
gallery	1

what	1
can	1
she	1
do	1
?	1

back	1
to	1
the	1

went	1
up	1

first	1

i	1
had	1
no	1
idea	1

how	1

committed	1

but	1
from	1
what	1

fancied	1
that	1

would	1
be	1
very	1
hard	1
to	1
find	1
anything	1

connect	1
him	1
with	1
it	1

when	1
i	1
arrived	1
at	1

i	1
realized	1
at	1
once	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
who	1
had	1
burnt	1
the	1
will	1

there	1

by	1

way	1

you	1
can	1
not	1
complain	1

my	1
friend	1
,	1
for	1
i	1
tried	1
my	1
best	1
to	1
force	1
on	1
you	1
the	1
significance	1
of	1
that	1
bedroom	1
fire	1
in	1
midsummer	1

i	0

well	1
,	1
my	1

as	1
i	1
say	1
,	1
my	1
views	1
as	1
to	1
mr.	1
inglethorp	1
's	1
guilt	1
were	1
very	1
much	1
shaken	1
.	1
there	1
was	1
,	1
in	1
fact	1
,	1
so	1
much	1
evidence	1
against	1
him	1
that	1
i	1
was	1
inclined	1
to	1
believe	1
that	1
he	1
had	1
not	1
done	1
it	1
.	1

when	1
did	1
you	1
change	1
your	1
mind	1
?	1

when	1
i	1
found	1
that	1
the	1
more	1
efforts	1
i	1
made	1
to	1
clear	1
him	1
,	1
the	1
more	1
efforts	1
he	1
made	1
to	1
get	1
himself	1
arrested	1
.	1
then	1
,	1
when	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
inglethorp	1
had	1
nothing	1
to	1
do	1
with	1
mrs.	1
raikes	1
and	1
that	1
in	1
fact	1
it	1
was	1
john	1
cavendish	1
who	1
was	1
interested	1
in	1
that	1
quarter	1
,	1
i	1
was	1
quite	1
sure	1
.	1

but	1
why	1
?	1

simply	1
this	1
.	1
if	1
it	1
had	1
been	1
inglethorp	1
who	1
was	1
carrying	1
on	1
an	1
intrigue	1
with	1
mrs.	1
raikes	1
,	1
his	1
silence	1
was	1
perfectly	1
comprehensible	1
.	1
but	1
,	1
when	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
known	1
all	1
over	1
the	1
village	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
john	1
who	1
was	1
attracted	1
by	1
the	1
farmer	1
's	1
pretty	1
wife	1
,	1
his	1
silence	1
bore	1
quite	1
a	1
different	1
interpretation	1
.	1
it	1
was	1
nonsense	1
to	1
pretend	1
that	1
he	1
was	1
afraid	1
of	1
the	1
scandal	1
,	1
as	1
no	1
possible	1
scandal	1
could	1
attach	1
to	1
him	1
.	1
this	1
attitude	1
of	1
his	1
gave	1
me	1
furiously	1
to	1
think	1
,	1
and	1
i	1
was	1
slowly	1
forced	1
to	1
the	1
conclusion	1
that	1
alfred	1
inglethorp	1
wanted	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
.	1
eh	1
bien	1
!	1
from	1
that	1
moment	1
,	1
i	1
was	1
equally	1
determined	1
that	1
he	1
should	1
not	1
be	1
arrested	1
.	1

wait	1
a	1
minute	1
.	1
i	1
do	1
n't	1
see	1
why	1
he	1
wished	1
to	1
be	1
arrested	1
?	1

because	1
,	1
mon	1
ami	1
,	1
it	1
is	1
the	1
law	1
of	1
your	1
country	1
that	1
a	1
man	1
once	1
acquitted	1
can	1
never	1
be	1
tried	1
again	1
for	1
the	1
same	1
offence	1
.	1
aha	1
!	1
but	1
it	1
was	1
clever	1
--	1
his	1
idea	1
!	1
assuredly	1
,	1
he	1
is	1

in	1

position	1
he	1

bound	1

so	1
he	1
conceived	1

idea	1

evidence	1

my	1
poor	1
friend	1

you	1
have	1
not	1

realized	1
that	1
it	1

miss	1

went	1

,	1
certainly	1

who	1

it	1
was	1
most	1
easy	1
for	1
her	1

she	1
is	1
of	1
a	1
good	1
height	1

her	1
voice	1
is	1
deep	1
and	1
manly	1
;	1
moreover	1
,	1
remember	1
,	1
she	1
and	1
inglethorp	1
are	1
cousins	1
,	1
and	1
there	1
is	1
a	1
distinct	1
resemblance	1
between	1
them	1

especially	1
in	1
their	1
gait	1
and	1
bearing	1
.	1
it	1
was	1
simplicity	1
itself	1

they	1
are	1
a	1
clever	1
pair	1

i	1
am	1
still	1
a	1
little	1
fogged	1

to	1
how	1
exactly	1
the	1

i	1
will	1

for	1
you	1
as	1
far	1
as	1
possible	1

i	1
am	1
inclined	1
to	1
think	1
that	1
miss	1
howard	1
was	1
the	1
master	1
mind	1
in	1
that	1
affair	1
.	1
you	1
remember	1
her	1
once	1
mentioning	1
that	1
her	1
father	1
was	1
a	1
doctor	1
?	1
possibly	1
she	1
dispensed	1
his	1
medicines	1
for	1
him	1
,	1
or	1
she	1
may	1
have	1
taken	1
the	1
idea	1
from	1
one	1
of	1
the	1
many	1
books	1
lying	1
about	1
when	1
mademoiselle	1
cynthia	1
was	1
studying	1
for	1
her	1
exam	1
.	1
anyway	1
,	1
she	1
was	1
familiar	1
with	1
the	1
fact	1
that	1
the	1
addition	1
of	1
a	1
bromide	1
to	1
a	1
mixture	1
containing	1
strychnine	1
would	1
cause	1
the	1
precipitation	1
of	1
the	1
latter	1
.	1
probably	1
the	1
idea	1
came	1
to	1
her	1
quite	1
suddenly	1
.	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
had	1
a	1
box	1
of	1
bromide	1
powders	1
,	1
which	1
she	1
occasionally	1
took	1
at	1
night	1
.	1
what	1
could	1
be	1
easier	1
than	1
quietly	1
to	1
dissolve	1
one	1
or	1
more	1
of	1
those	1
powders	1
in	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
's	1
large	1
sized	1
bottle	1
of	1
medicine	1
when	1
it	1
came	1
from	1
coot	1
's	1
?	1
the	1
risk	1
is	1
practically	1
nil	1
.	1
the	1
tragedy	1
will	1
not	1
take	1
place	1
until	1
nearly	1
a	1
fortnight	1
later	1

if	1
anyone	1
has	1
seen	1
either	1
of	1
them	1
touching	1
the	1
medicine	1
,	1
they	1
will	1
have	1
forgotten	1
it	1
by	1
that	1
time	1

miss	1
howard	1
will	1
have	1
engineered	1
her	1
quarrel	1

departed	1
from	1
the	1
house	1

the	1
lapse	1
of	1
time	1

and	1
her	1
absence	1
,	1
will	1
defeat	1
all	1

it	1
was	1
a	1
clever	1
idea	1

if	1

left	1
it	1
alone	1

it	1
is	1
possible	1

them	1

they	1
were	1

from	1
the	1

ran	1

realized	1

earlier	1
in	1
the	1
morning	1
,	1
when	1
we	1
had	1
been	1
there	1
together	1
,	1
i	1
had	1
straightened	1
all	1
the	1
objects	1
on	1
the	1
mantel-piece	1
.	1
and	1
,	1
if	1
they	1
were	1
already	1
straightened	1
,	1
there	1
would	1
be	1
no	1
need	1
to	1
straighten	1
them	1
again	1
,	1
unless	1
,	1
in	1
the	1
meantime	1
,	1
some	1
one	1
else	1
had	1
touched	1
them	1
.	1

dear	1
me	1
,	1
i	0
murmured	0
,	0
so	1
that	1
is	1
the	1
explanation	1
of	1
your	1
extraordinary	1
behaviour	1
.	1
you	1
rushed	1
down	1
to	1
styles	1
,	1
and	1
found	1
it	1
still	1
there	1
?	1

yes	1
,	1
and	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
race	1
for	1
time	1
.	1

but	1
i	1
still	1
ca	1
n't	1
understand	1
why	1
inglethorp	1
was	1
such	1
a	1
fool	1
as	1
to	1
leave	1
it	1
there	1
when	1
he	1
had	1
plenty	1
of	1
opportunity	1
to	1
destroy	1
it	1
.	1

ah	1
,	1
but	1
he	1
had	1
no	1
opportunity	1
.	1
i	1
saw	1
to	1
that	1
.	1

you	1
?	1

yes	1
.	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
reproving	1
me	1
for	1
taking	1
the	1
household	1
into	1
my	1
confidence	1
on	1
the	1
subject	1
?	1

yes	1
.	1

well	1
,	1
my	1
friend	1
,	1
i	1
saw	1
there	1
was	1
just	1
one	1
chance	1
.	1
i	1
was	1
not	1
sure	1
then	1
if	1
inglethorp	1
was	1
the	1
criminal	1
or	1
not	1
,	1
but	1
if	1
he	1
was	1
i	1
reasoned	1
that	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
have	1
the	1
paper	1
on	1
him	1
,	1
but	1
would	1
have	1
hidden	1
it	1
somewhere	1
,	1
and	1
by	1
enlisting	1
the	1
sympathy	1
of	1
the	1
household	1
i	1
could	1
effectually	1
prevent	1
his	1
destroying	1
it	1
.	1
he	1
was	1
already	1
under	1
suspicion	1
,	1
and	1
by	1
making	1
the	1
matter	1
public	1
i	1
secured	1
the	1
services	1
of	1
about	1
ten	1
amateur	1
detectives	1
,	1
who	1
would	1
be	1
watching	1
him	1
unceasingly	1
,	1
and	1
being	1
himself	1
aware	1
of	1
their	1
watchfulness	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
dare	1
seek	1
further	1
to	1
destroy	1
the	1
document	1
.	1
he	1
was	1
therefore	1
forced	1
to	1
depart	1
from	1
the	1
house	1
,	1
leaving	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
spill	1
vase	1
.	1

but	1
surely	1
miss	1
howard	1
had	1
ample	1
opportunities	1
of	1
aiding	1
him	1
.	1

yes	1
,	1
but	1
miss	1
howard	1
did	1
not	1
know	1
of	1
the	1
paper	1
's	1
existence	1
.	1
in	1
accordance	1
with	1
their	1
prearranged	1
plan	1
,	1
she	1
never	1
spoke	1
to	1
alfred	1
inglethorp	1
.	1
they	1
were	1
supposed	1
to	1
be	1
deadly	1
enemies	1
,	1
and	1
until	1
john	1
cavendish	1
was	1
safely	1
convicted	1
they	1
neither	1
of	1
them	1
dared	1
risk	1
a	1
meeting	1
.	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
watch	1
kept	1
on	1
mr.	1
inglethorp	1
,	1
hoping	1
that	1
sooner	1
or	1
later	1
he	1
would	1
lead	1
me	1
to	1
the	1
hiding-place	1
.	1
but	1
he	1
was	1
too	1
clever	1
to	1
take	1
any	1
chances	1
.	1
the	1
paper	1
was	1
safe	1
where	1
it	1
was	1
;	1
since	1
no	1
one	1
had	1
thought	1
of	1
looking	1
there	1
in	1
the	1
first	1
week	1
,	1
it	1
was	1
not	1
likely	1
they	1
would	1
do	1
so	1
afterwards	1
.	1
but	1
for	1
your	1
lucky	1
remark	1
,	1
we	1
might	1
never	1
have	1
been	1
able	1
to	1
bring	1
him	1
to	1
justice	1
.	1

i	1
understand	1
that	1
now	1
;	1
but	1
when	1
did	1
you	1
first	1
begin	1
to	1
suspect	1
miss	1
howard	1
?	1

when	1
i	1
discovered	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
told	1
a	1
lie	1
at	1
the	1
inquest	1
about	1
the	1
letter	1
she	1
had	1
received	1
from	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
.	1

why	1
,	1
what	1
was	1
there	1
to	1
lie	1
about	1
?	1

you	1
saw	1
that	1
letter	1
?	1
do	1
you	1
recall	1
its	1
general	1
appearance	1
?	1

yes	1
--	1
more	1
or	1
less	1
.	1

you	1
will	1
recollect	1
,	1
then	1
,	1
that	1
mrs.	1
inglethorp	1
wrote	1
a	1
very	1
distinctive	1
hand	1
,	1
and	1
left	1
large	1
clear	1
spaces	1
between	1
her	1
words	1
.	1
but	1
if	1
you	1
look	1
at	1
the	1
date	1
at	1
the	1
top	1
of	1
the	1
letter	1
you	1
will	1
notice	1
that	1
'july	1
17th	1
'	1
is	1
quite	1
different	1
in	1
this	1
respect	1
.	1
do	1
you	1
see	1
what	1
i	1
mean	1
?	1

no	1
,	1
i	0
confessed	0
,	0
i	1
do	1
n't	1
.	1

you	1
do	1
not	1
see	1
that	1
that	1
letter	1
was	1
not	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
17th	1
,	1
but	1
on	1
the	1
7th	1
--	1
the	1
day	1
after	1
miss	1
howard	1
's	1
departure	1
?	1
the	1
'1	1
'	1
was	1
written	1
in	1
before	1
the	1
'7	1
'	1
to	1
turn	1
it	1
into	1
the	1
'17th	1
'	1
.	1

but	1
why	1
?	1

that	1
is	1
exactly	1
what	1
i	1
asked	1
myself	1
.	1
why	1
does	1
miss	1
howard	1
suppress	1
the	1
letter	1
written	1
on	1
the	1
17th	1
,	1
and	1
produce	1
this	1
faked	1
one	1
instead	1
?	1
because	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
wish	1
to	1
show	1
the	1
letter	1
of	1
the	1
17th	1
.	1
why	1
,	1
again	1
?	1
and	1
at	1
once	1
a	1
suspicion	1
dawned	1
in	1
my	1
mind	1
.	1
you	1
will	1
remember	1

it	1

to	1
the	1

knew	1
something	1
about	1
the	1
matter	1

he	1
was	1
nearly	1
driven	1
desperate	1

first	1
he	1
crushed	1
the	1
coffee-cup	1
to	1
powder	1
under	1
his	1
feet	1
,	1
remembering	1
that	1
she	1
had	1
gone	1
up	1
with	1
his	1
mother	1
the	1
night	1
before	1

he	1
determined	1
that	1
there	1
should	1
be	1
no	1
chance	1
of	1
testing	1
its	1
contents	1
.	1
thenceforward	1
,	1
he	1
strenuously	1

quite	1
uselessly	1

upheld	1
the	1
theory	1
of	1
'death	1

what	1
about	1

my	1
dear	1
friend	1
,	1
do	1
you	1
not	1
realize	1
that	1
it	1
was	1
simply	1
and	1
solely	1
the	1
trial	1
which	1
has	1
brought	1
them	1
together	1
again	1
?	1
that	1
john	1
cavendish	1
still	1
loved	1
his	1
wife	1
,	1
i	1
was	1
convinced	1
.	1
also	1
,	1
that	1
she	1
was	1
equally	1
in	1
love	1
with	1
him	1
.	1
but	1
they	1
had	1
drifted	1
very	1
far	1
apart	1
.	1
it	1
all	1
arose	1
from	1
a	1
misunderstanding	1
.	1
she	1
married	1
him	1
without	1
love	1
.	1
he	1
knew	1
it	1
.	1
he	1
is	1
a	1
sensitive	1
man	1
in	1
his	1
way	1
,	1
he	1
would	1
not	1
force	1
himself	1
upon	1
her	1
if	1
she	1
did	1
not	1
want	1
him	1
.	1
and	1
,	1
as	1
he	1
withdrew	1
,	1
her	1
love	1
awoke	1
.	1
but	1
they	1
are	1
both	1
unusually	1
proud	1
,	1
and	1
their	1
pride	1
held	1
them	1
inexorably	1
apart	1
.	1
he	1
drifted	1
into	1
an	1
entanglement	1
with	1
mrs.	1
raikes	1
,	1
and	1
she	1
deliberately	1
cultivated	1
the	1
friendship	1
of	1
dr.	1
bauerstein	1
.	1
do	1
you	1
remember	1
the	1
day	1
of	1
john	1
cavendish	1
's	1
arrest	1
,	1
when	1
you	1
found	1
me	1
deliberating	1
over	1
a	1
big	1
decision	1
?	1

yes	1
,	1
i	1
quite	1
understood	1
your	1
distress	1
.	1

pardon	1
me	1
,	1
mon	1
ami	1
,	1
but	1
you	1
did	1
not	1
understand	1
it	1
in	1
the	1
least	1
.	1
i	1
was	1
trying	1
to	1
decide	1
whether	1
or	1
not	1
i	1
would	1
clear	1
john	1
cavendish	1
at	1
once	1
.	1
i	1
could	1
have	1
cleared	1
him	1
--	1
though	1
it	1
might	1
have	1
meant	1
a	1
failure	1
to	1
convict	1
the	1
real	1
criminals	1
.	1
they	1
were	1
entirely	1
in	1
the	1
dark	1
as	1
to	1
my	1
real	1
attitude	1
up	1
to	1
the	1
very	1
last	1
moment	1
--	1
which	1
partly	1
accounts	1
for	1
my	1
success	1

do	1
you	1
mean	1
that	1
you	1
could	1
have	1
saved	1
john	1
cavendish	1
from	1
being	1
brought	1
to	1
trial	1
?	1

yes	1
,	1
my	1
friend	1

i	1
eventually	1
decided	1
in	1
favour	1
of	1
'a	1
woman	1
's	1
happiness	1
'	1
.	1
nothing	1
but	1
the	1
great	1
danger	1
through	1
which	1
they	1
have	1
passed	1
could	1
