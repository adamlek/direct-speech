having	1
to	1
bother	1
a	1
long	1
time	1

they	1
'll	1
get	1
the	1
nigger	1
pretty	1
soon	1
now	1
,	1
and	1
maybe	1
they	1
can	1
scare	1
it	1
out	1
of	1
him	1
.	1

why	1
,	1
are	1
they	1
after	1
him	1

the	1

n't	1
far	1
from	1
here	1
.	1
i	1
'm	1
one	1
of	1
them	1
--	1
but	1
i	1
hai	1
n't	1
talked	1
it	1
around	1
.	1
a	1
few	1
days	1
ago	1
i	1
was	1
talking	1
with	1
an	1
old	1
couple	1
that	1
lives	1
next	1
door	1
in	1
the	1
log	1
shanty	1
,	1
and	1
they	1
happened	1
to	1
say	1
hardly	1
anybody	1
ever	1
goes	1
to	1
that	1
island	1
over	1
yonder	1
that	1
they	1
call	1
jackson	1
's	1
island	1
.	1
do	1
n't	1
anybody	1
live	1
there	1
?	1
says	1
i.	1
no	1
,	1
nobody	1
,	1
says	1
they	1
.	1
i	1
did	1
n't	1
say	1
any	1
more	1
,	1
but	1
i	1
done	1
some	1
thinking	1
.	1
i	1
was	1
pretty	1
near	1
certain	1
i	1
'd	1
seen	1
smoke	1
over	1
there	1
,	1
about	1
the	1
head	1
of	1
the	1
island	1
,	1
a	1
day	1
or	1
two	1
before	1
that	1
,	1
so	1
i	1
says	1
to	1
myself	1
,	1
like	1
as	1
not	1
that	1
nigger	1
's	1
hiding	1
over	1
there	1
;	1
anyway	1
,	1
says	1
i	1
,	1
it	1
's	1

.	1
i	1
hai	1
n't	1

so	0
we	0

and	0
dropped	0
it	0
in	0
her	0

it	0
all	0
right	0
,	0
along	0
with	0
her	0
shingle	0
nail	0
,	0
before	0
noon	0
.	0
we	0
was	0
very	0
well	0
satisfied	0
with	0
this	0
business	0
,	0
and	0
tom	0
allowed	0
it	0
was	0
worth	0
twice	0
the	0
trouble	0
it	0
took	0
,	0
because	0
he	0
said	0
now	0
she	0
could	0
n't	0
ever	0
count	0
them	0
spoons	0
twice	0
alike	0
again	0
to	0

her	0
life	0
;	0
and	0
would	0
n't	0
believe	0
she	0
'd	0
counted	0
them	0
right	0
if	0
she	0
did	0
;	0
and	0
said	0
that	0
after	0
she	0
'd	0
about	0
counted	0
her	0
head	0
off	0
for	0
the	0
next	0
three	0

anybody	0
that	0
wanted	0
her	0
to	0
ever	0

so	0
we	0
put	0
the	0
sheet	0
back	0
on	0
the	0
line	0
that	0
night	0
,	0
and	0
stole	0
one	0
out	0

and	0
kept	0
on	0
putting	0
it	0
back	0

it	0
again	0
for	0
a	0

but	0
that	0

was	0
a	0
job	0
;	0
we	0
had	0
no	0
end	0
of	0

with	0
that	0

we	0
fixed	0
it	0
up	0
away	0
down	0

cooked	0
it	0
there	0

at	0

very	0
satisfactory	0

too	0
;	0

not	0
all	0
in	0
one	0

and	0
we	0
had	0
to	0

up	0
three	0

,	0
in	0

,	0
and	0
eyes	0
put	0
out	0

we	0
did	0
n't	0
want	0
nothing	0
but	0
a	0
crust	0
,	0
and	0
we	0
could	0
n't	0
prop	0
it	0
up	0
right	0
,	0
and	0
she	0
would	0
always	0
cave	0
in	0

but	0
of	0

we	0

which	0
was	0
to	0
cook	0
the	0
ladder	0

nine	0

and	0
in	0
the	0
forenoon	0
we	0
took	0
it	0
down	0
to	0
the	0

it	0
would	0
n't	0

made	0
of	0
a	0
whole	0

the	1
minute	1
i	1

it	1
out	1
crawls	1
this	1
nigger	1
from	1
somewheres	1
and	1
says	1
he	1
'll	1
help	1

he	1
done	1
it	1
,	1
too	1
,	1
and	1
done	1
it	1
very	1
well	1

i	1
judged	1
he	1
must	1
be	1
a	1
runaway	1
nigger	1
,	1
and	1
there	1
i	1
was	1
!	1
and	1
there	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
stick	1
right	1
straight	1
along	1
all	1
the	1
rest	1
of	1
the	1
day	1
and	1
all	1
night	1
.	1
it	1
was	1
a	1
fix	1
,	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
!	1
i	1
had	1
a	1
couple	1
of	1
patients	1
with	1
the	1
chills	1
,	1
and	1
of	1
course	1
i	1
'd	1
of	1
liked	1
to	1
run	1
up	1
to	1
town	1
and	1
see	1
them	1
,	1
but	1
i	1
das	1
n't	1
,	1
because	1
the	1
nigger	1
might	1
get	1
away	1
,	1
and	1
then	1
i	1
'd	1
be	1
to	1
blame	1
;	1
and	1
yet	1
never	1
a	1
skiff	1
come	1
close	1
enough	1
for	1
me	1
to	1
hail	1
.	1
so	1
there	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
stick	1
plumb	1
until	1
daylight	1
this	1
morning	1
;	1
and	1
i	1
never	1
see	1
a	1
nigger	1
that	1
was	1
a	1
better	1
nuss	1
or	1
faithfuller	1
,	1
and	1
yet	1
he	1
was	1
risking	1
his	1
freedom	1
to	1
do	1
it	1
,	1
and	1
was	1
all	1
tired	1
out	1
,	1
too	1
,	1
and	1
i	1
see	1
plain	1
enough	1
he	1
'd	1
been	1
worked	1
main	1
hard	1
lately	1
.	1
i	1
liked	1
the	1
nigger	1
for	1
that	1
;	1
i	1
tell	1
you	1
,	1
gentlemen	1
,	1
a	1
nigger	1
like	1
that	1
is	1
worth	1
a	1
thousand	1
dollars	1
--	1
and	1
kind	1
treatment	1
,	1
too	1
.	1
i	1
had	1
everything	1
i	1
needed	1
,	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
was	1
doing	1
as	1
well	1
there	1
as	1
he	1
would	1
a	1
done	1
at	1
home	1
--	1
better	1
,	1
maybe	1
,	1
because	1
it	1
was	1
so	1
quiet	1
;	1
but	1
there	1
i	1
was	1
,	1
with	1
both	1
of	1
'm	1
on	1
my	1
hands	1
,	1
and	1
there	1
i	1
had	1
to	1
stick	1
till	1
about	1
dawn	1
this	1
morning	1
;	1
then	1
some	1
men	1
in	1
a	1
skiff	1
come	1
by	1
,	1
and	1
as	1
good	1
luck	1
would	1
have	1
it	1
the	1
nigger	1
was	1
setting	1
by	1
the	1
pallet	1
with	1
his	1
head	1
propped	1
on	1
his	1
knees	1
sound	1
asleep	1
;	1
so	1
i	1
motioned	1
them	1
in	1
quiet	1
,	1
and	1
they	1
slipped	1
up	1
on	1
him	1
and	1
grabbed	1
him	1
and	1
tied	1
him	1
before	1
he	1
knowed	1
what	1
he	1
was	1
about	1
,	1
and	1
we	1
never	1
had	1
no	1
trouble	1
.	1
and	1
the	1
boy	1
being	1
in	1
a	1
kind	1
of	1
a	1
flighty	1
sleep	1
,	1
too	1
,	1
we	1
muffled	1
the	1
oars	1
and	1
hitched	1
the	1
raft	1
on	1
,	1
and	1
towed	1
her	1
over	1
very	1
nice	1
and	1
quiet	1
,	1
and	1
the	1
nigger	1
never	1
made	1
the	1
least	1
row	1
nor	1
said	1
a	1
word	1
from	1
the	1
start	1
.	1
he	1
ai	1
n't	1
no	1
bad	1
nigger	1
,	1
gentlemen	1
;	1
that	1
's	1
what	1
i	1
think	1
about	1
him	1
.	1

somebody	0
says	0
:	0

well	1
,	1
it	1
sounds	1
very	1
good	1
,	1
doctor	1
,	1
i	1
'm	1
obleeged	1
to	1
say	1
.	1

then	0
the	0
others	0
softened	0
up	0
a	0
little	0
,	0
too	0
,	0
and	0
i	0
was	0
mighty	0
thankful	0
to	0
that	0
old	0
doctor	0
for	0
doing	0
jim	0
that	0
good	0
turn	0
;	0
and	0
i	0
was	0
glad	0
it	0
was	0
according	0
to	0
my	0
judgment	0
of	0
him	0
,	0
too	0
;	0
because	0
i	0
thought	0
he	0
had	0
a	0
good	0
heart	0
in	0
him	0
and	0
was	0
a	0
good	0
man	0
the	0
first	0
time	0
i	0
see	0
him	0
.	0
then	0
they	0
all	0
agreed	0
that	0
jim	0
had	0
acted	0
very	0
well	0
,	0
and	0
was	0
deserving	0
to	0
have	0
some	0
notice	0
took	0
of	0
it	0
,	0
and	0
reward	0
.	0
so	0
every	0
one	0
of	0
them	0
promised	0
,	0
right	0
out	0
and	0
hearty	0
,	0
that	0
they	0
would	0
n't	0
cuss	0
him	0
no	0
more	0
.	0

then	0
they	0
come	0
out	0
and	0
locked	0
him	0
up	0
.	0
i	0
hoped	0
they	0
was	0
going	0
to	0
say	0
he	0
could	0
have	0
one	0
or	0
two	0
of	0
the	0
chains	0
took	0
off	0
,	0
because	0
they	0
was	0
rotten	0
heavy	0

or	0
could	0
have	0
meat	0
and	0
greens	0
with	0
his	0
bread	0
and	0
water	0
;	0
but	0
they	0
did	0
n't	0
think	0
of	0
it	0
,	0
and	0
i	0
reckoned	0
it	0
war	0
n't	0
best	0
for	0
me	0
to	0
mix	0
in	0
,	0

i	0

'd	0
get	0
the	0
doctor	0
's	0
yarn	0
to	0
aunt	0
sally	0
somehow	0
or	0

i	0
slips	0
to	0
the	0

if	0
i	0
found	0
him	0

up	0
a	0

in	0
about	0
half	0

we	0

all	0
the	0

he	0
